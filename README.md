# IANServer

The project I helped develop for our Intro to Software Engineering course at UNO during the summer of 2019.  

- Server: written in golang
- HTML / CSS / JS

We had wanted our original project to be written with the help of Angular, but due to time constraints we settled on a front-end that used vanilla JS.
